# Project Belobog
## Overview
This is the first prototype demo for Project Belobog. 
Belobog is a third-person stylized action horror game for more details click [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FlZdw0D3veuY0ubyzADCBhKjMk-Xzyvh3hhhPJUY8hg/edit?usp=sharing).
Due the use of multiple purchased plugins and 3D animations, the source code cannot be uploaded publicly as the project cannot be opened 
without the plugins.

## How To Play
**NOTE:** The demo is about 2GB and runs on Windows. The Linux and MacOS versions are available but they are yet to be tested.
1. Go to this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sr_qnRn2U2TBJEV76a_1YPemgNKj0POf?usp=share_link)
2. Download and extract the zip folder for your operating system
3. Run **ProjectBelobog.exe**

## Project Details
### My Role
This project began as a hobby for myself and a colleague. As we progressed, our team grew as well as our ambitions. 
My collegue and I are the project leaders for this game. \
I am responsible for all the code and functionalities of the project. I am tasked with planning and designing game systems (such as combat, 
movement, dialogue, etc) that can match with our theme of horror and brutality. \
Once we have a demo that clearly defines the direction of our art style, we will start inviting programmers to this project.
At that point, our attention will move from developing rough system prototypes to fine-tuning and perfecting our features.

### Challenges
Creating designs and functionalities that worked together to match our theme was a major problem early on in this project.
It took us a long time to create a working concept since we would often focus on refining our inventions before verifying their practicality. \
I proposed to change our work process. Instead of spending time on polishing ideas, we should first construct
very rough prototypes to test the feasibility of our concepts. \
This improved our ideas and productivity. It is much easier to evaluate new ideas when you can see them at action.

### Future Plans
The end goal for this project is market release. 

### Next Updates
A working quest and dialogue system is ready and will be integrated with a real world demo.
- A level demo (world of Belobog)
- More interactivity
  - Dialogue
  - Quests
- Improved combat design
  - Better flow of movement
  - Smarter AI
- Improved UI design
- Combat music
- Sound FX
